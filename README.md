"Your personal therapy assistant Clep is at your service!"

We have decided to create a therapy AI in the roughly 48 hours we were given. In this time frame we have focused on training Clep to be not only responive but relatable! Sadly, this is also Clep's downfall due to his young age. Being only a few hours old and with limited training Clep still has some difficulty being available for those who need it. Additionally, due to Clep's HUGE personality it often takes it a little bit of time to respond properly. With time however we expect Clep to be able to give proper and concise information in a timely manner!
